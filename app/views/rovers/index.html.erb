        This API is designed to collect image data gathered by NASA's Curiosity, Opportunity, and Spirit rovers on Mars and make it more easily available to other developers, educators, and citizen scientists.

        This version is considered pre-release, and may change frequently until 1.0.0 is released.

      <h3>Photo Attributes</h3>

      <p>
        Each rover has its own set of photos store in the database, which can be queried separately. There are several possible queries that can be made against the API. Photos are organized by the sol (Martian rotation or day) on which they were taken, counting up from the rover's landing date. A photo taken on Curiosity's 1000th Martian sol exploring Mars, for example, will have a sol attribute of 1000. If instead you prefer to search by the Earth date on which a photo was taken, you can do that too. Dates are formatted as yyyy-mm-dd.
      </p>

      <p>
        Along with querying by date, results can also be filtered by which camera with which it was taken. Each camera has a unique function and perspective. More information about each rover's cameras can be found on the page for that rover.
      </p>

      <h3>Querying the API</h3>

      <p>
        The API can be queried in the following format:
      </p>

      <h4>Queries by Martian sol:</h4>

      <p>
        Queries by sol can range from 0, which is the date of landing, up to the current maximum in the database. The current max sol can be found at http://mars-photos.herokuapp.com at present.

        <p class="query-example">
          http://mars-photos.herokuapp.com/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos?sol=1000
        </p>
      </p>

      <h4>Querying by Earth date:</h4>

      <p>
        Dates should be formatted as 'yyyy-mm-dd'. The earliest date available is the date of landing for each rover.

        <p class="query-example">
          http://mars-photos.herokuapp.com/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos?earth_date=2015-6-3
        </p>
      </p>

      <h4>Filtering Queries by Camera:</h4>

      <p>
        The camera parameter is not case sensitive, but must be one of the camera abbreviations listed in the table above for the respective rover.

        <p class="query-example">
          http://mars-photos.herokuapp.com/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos?sol=1000&camera=fhaz
        </p>
        <p class="query-example">
          http://mars-photos.herokuapp.com/api/v1/rovers/opportunity/photos?earth_date=2015-6-3&camera=pancam
        </p>

      </p>

      <h4>Paginated Results</h4>

      <p>
        Responses will be limited to 25 photos per call. Queries that should return more than 25 photos will be split onto several pages, which can be accessed by adding a 'page' param to the query.

        <p class="query-example">
          http://mars-photos.herokuapp.com/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos?sol=1000&page=2
        </p>
      </p>

        The database will be updated regularly with the latest photos from the red planet.
